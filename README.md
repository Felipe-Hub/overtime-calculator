# overtime-calculator
An overtime worked hours calculator based on e-mail parsing.

Hello, GitHub!  I'm a beginner programmer and this is my first project at github. Please, bear with me.  As a brazilian lawyer I've encountered many clients wanting to calculate their employees overtime worked hours. Some had only e-mails as parameters to calculate the amount of payment due as overtime.

The problem about making such calculations was in the extensive amount of e-mails (thousands) I had to read.  The solution I've found was to develop a program that could read e-mails saved in .msg format and parse the information I needed (time, date and day of the week), followed by the respective calculations (according to brazilian labor laws). 

Since I want to work with pandas for practice purposes, I've also decided to put some information and calculations in dataframe format.
